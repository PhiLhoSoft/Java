Java
====

Small experiments in Java, and some utility classes too.

*Articles* is a collection of URLs (in Microsoft's .url format, which is plain text) of articles on Java.

*_QuickExperiments* is to make... quick experiments, usually without library, compiled and run from the command line.

*Experiments* is where I do the more ambitious experiments. It is an Eclipse project and can involve libraries.

*Utilities* is a collection of small utility classes, or some more ambitious projects like the Mif parser.
These are still small projects, not worth a separate Git repository.

I recently (Nov 2014) converted the repository from Bazaar to Git, moving it online from Launchpad to GitHub.
