### Swing methods to re-paint and re-layout

- AWT: java.awt.Component
invalidate(): Invalidates the container. The container and all parents above it are marked as needing to be laid out (cached layout and size are dropped).
paint(): Paints this component.
print(): Prints this component.
repaint(): Repaints this component. [For application-triggered painting, eg. after changing state of component.]

- AWT: java.awt.Container extends java.awt.Component
doLayout(): Causes this container to lay out its components. Do not call, use validate() instead.
invalidate(): Invalidates the container. The container and all parents above it are marked as needing to be laid out. This method can be called often, so it needs to execute quickly.
paint():  Paints the container.
paintComponents():  Paints each of the components in this container.
print(): Prints the container.
printComponents(): Prints each of the components in this container.
update(): Updates the container. [Called by repaint(). Multiple calls to repaint() are collapsed into one update() call. Default update() clears the background and calls paint(). Can be used for incremental painting.]
validate(): Validates this container and all of its subcomponents. Cause a container to lay out its subcomponents again.

- AWT: java.awt.Window extends java.awt.Container
pack(): Causes this Window to be sized to fit the preferred size and layouts of its subcomponents. If the window and/or its owner are not yet displayable, both are made displayable before calculating the preferred size. The Window will be validated [call to validate()] after the preferredSize is calculated.

- AWT: java.awt.Frame extends java.awt.Window
pack()

- Swing: javax.swing.JComponent extends java.awt.Container
paint():  Invoked by Swing to draw components. [paint() invokes paintComponent(), paintBorder() and paintChildren().]
paintBorder():  Paints the component's border. [No need to override.]
paintComponent():  Calls the UI delegate's paint method, if the UI delegate is non-null. [Should be overridden instead of paint(). Calls ui.update() (look-and-feel) which calls ui.paint(). Unlike AWT's one, default ui.update() doesn't clear background if component isn't opaque.]
paintChildren():  Paints this component's children. [No need to override.]
paintImmediately(): Paints the specified region now. [Synchronous painting, for real-time painting (eg. scroll pane). No need to override.]
print(): Invoke this method to print the component to the specified Graphics.
printAll(): Invoke this method to print the component.
printBorder():  Prints the component's border.
printComponent():  Calls the UI delegate's print method, if the UI delegate is non-null.
printChildren():  Prints this component's children.
repaint(): Adds the specified region to the dirty region list if the component is showing. [For app-triggered painting.]
revalidate(): Supports deferred automatic layout. [To call after adding/removing components.]
update(): Calls paint. [Actually never invoked.]
updateUI(): Resets the UI property to a value from the current look and feel. [Not to use in general.]

- Swing: javax.swing.JWindow extends java.awt.Window
pack()
repaint(): Repaints the specified rectangle of this component within time milliseconds.
update(): Calls paint(g).

- Swing: javax.swing.JFrame extends java.awt.Frame
pack()
repaint(): Repaints the specified rectangle of this component within time milliseconds.
update(): Just calls paint(g).

Swing's paint() uses double buffering. print() does not.

Use revalidate() to cause a validation of components to happen on the EDT. This internally calls invalidate() to invalidate that container and sub-containers and then queues an operation to re-layout that container and all subcontainers. You don't need to call invalidate()/validate() separately in Swing.
This differs from AWT where upon adding/removing/changing a component size, you need call invalidate()/validate() upon the container things have been added to.

AWT Painting Guidelines
The AWT provides a simple callback API for painting components. When you use it, the following guidelines apply:

   1. For most programs, all client paint code should be placed within the scope of the component's paint() method.
   2. Programs may trigger a future call to paint() by invoking repaint(), but shouldn't call paint() directly.
   3. On components with complex output, repaint() should be invoked with arguments which define only the rectangle that needs updating, rather than the no-arg version, which causes the entire component to be repainted.
   4. Since a call to repaint() results first in a call to update(), which is forwarded to paint() by default, heavyweight components may override update() to do incremental drawing if desired (lightweights do not support incremental drawing)
   5. Extensions of java.awt.Container which override paint() should always invoke super.paint() to ensure children are painted.
   6. Components which render complex output should make smart use of the clip rectangle to narrow the drawing operations to those which intersects with the clip area.

Swing Painting Guidelines
Swing programs should understand these guidelines when writing paint code:

   1. For Swing components, paint() is always invoked as a result of both system-triggered and app-triggered paint requests;update() is never invoked on Swing components.
   2. Programs may trigger a future call to paint() by invoking repaint(), but shouldn't call paint() directly.
   3. On components with complex output, repaint() should be invoked with arguments which define only the rectangle that needs updating, rather than the no-arg version, which causes the entire component to be repainted.
   4. Swing's implementation of paint() factors the call into 3 separate callbacks:
         1. paintComponent()
         2. paintBorder()
         3. paintChildren()
      Extensions of Swing components which wish to implement their own paint code should place this code within the scope of the paintComponent() method (not within paint()).
   5. Swing introduces two properties to maximize painting efficiency:
          * opaque: will the component paint all its bits or not?
          * optimizedDrawingEnabled: may any of this component's children overlap?
   6. If a Swing component's opaque property is set to true, then it is agreeing to paint all of the bits contained within its bounds (this includes clearing it's own background within paintComponent()), otherwise screen garbage may result.
   7. Setting either the opaque or optimizedDrawingEnabled properties to false on a component will cause more processing on each paint operation, therefore we recommend judicious use of both transparency and overlapping components.
   8. Extensions of Swing components which have UI delegates (including JPanel), should typically invoke super.paintComponent() within their own paintComponent() implementation. Since the UI delegate will take responsibility for clearing the background on opaque components, this will take care of #5.
   9. Swing supports built-in double-buffering via the JComponent doubleBuffered property, and it defaults to true for all Swing components, however setting it to true on a Swing container has the general effect of turning it on for all lightweight descendents of that container, regardless of their individual property settings.
  10. It is strongly recommended that double-buffering be enabled for all Swing components.
  11. Components which render complex output should make smart use of the clip rectangle to narrow the drawing operations to those which intersect with the clip area.

paint is a container method which receives a graphics context and is used to render a container and all of its children
repaint is what we use in event code to ask a component to re-render itself
update: used in AWT drawing to avoid flicker; its use in Swing is not recommended/needed.
validate - container AWT method which we call when any changes have been made that might affect the layout of a container; asks the container to do a new layout of its children
revalidate - (a great) JComponent method with similiar affect to validate
invalidate - used to mark a component that needs to have its layout redone; occasionally used in AWT
doLayout - rarely used unless you are doing some lower-level layout research/work
pack is a top-level container method that will get everything layed out in the minimum space required and ready for display.
updateUI is used only when you need to change/update the look and feel

The following might help -

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html

My understanding or invalidate(), validate(), revalidate(), repaint() is as follows -

   1. invalidate()/validate()/revalidate() only affects the layout. It results in a repaint if the layout actually changes.
   2. invalidate()/validate() is the mechanism for batching changes (like beginPaint, paint, paint, paint, endPaint of windowing SDKs). You mark, using invalidate(), all the components that might affect the layout as invalid. Then call the parent container's validate() method. In the validate() method the parent checks if at least one of its immediate children is invalid. If it finds a child marked invalid, it calls layoutComponents() on its layout manager.

      If the layoutmanager actually re-lays out the children, then, as a side effect, repaint() will get called.

      The thing to note here is that the Container only looks for invalid immediate children.

      For precisely this reason sometimes the resulting layout is not what you expected as the parent's parent and children's chidren may not get re-layed out. To work around this issue Swing added the revalidate() method.
   3. What revalidate() does is basically marks all the container upto the top level (window and its subclasses or applet) as invalid. Then it calls validate() on the top level.

### Get a system color

Color bgColor = UIManager.getColor("Panel.background");

### Resources to free
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv8ts74_0vnstdfdh

A resource is as an object that must be closed manually,
such as a java.io.InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, Formatter;
java.nio.Channel; java.net.socket; java.sql.Connection, Statement, ResultSet,
or java.awt.Graphics.

Minimal (nearly) correct code to release a single resource today.

    static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
        try {
            return br.readLine();
        } finally {
            br.close(); // If exception is thrown, will hide the readLine one if any!
        }
    }

Static method to make a copy of a file, demonstrating the minimal correct code to release two resources today:

    static void copy(String src, String dest) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new FileInputStream(src);
        try {
            OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(dest);
            try {
                byte[] buf = new byte[8 * 1024];
                int n;
                while ((n = in.read(buf)) >= 0)
                    out.write(buf, 0, n);
            } finally {
                out.close();
            }
        } finally {
            in.close();
        }
    }

### If you want to make the file chooser read-only

// Do this before you create your file chooser -- this will affect all file choosers you create:
UIManager.put("FileChooser.readOnly", Boolean.TRUE);

### Make a Cancel button (dismiss dialog on Escape)

t.getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW)
   .put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("ESCAPE"), btnCancel.getAction());

where t is any component(except JButton) like JTextField in the dialog.

### Maximize the main window

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MaximizeTest() extends JFrame
{
     public static main(String args)
     {

               "Supports maximize:\n"
             + "  Horixontal " + toolkit.isFrameStateSupported(MAXIMIZED_HORIZ) + "\n"
             + "  Vertical   " + toolkit.isFrameStateSupported(MAXIMIZED_VERT ) + "\n"
             + "  Both       " + toolkit.isFrameStateSupported(MAXIMIZED_BOTH ) + "\n"
         );

         JFrame frame = new MaximizeTest("Maximize Test");
         frame.setSize(400, 300);
         // or:
         //  Set the normalized size
         //setBounds (100, 100, 600, 600);
         frame.setExtendedState(MAXIMIZED_BOTH);
         frame.show();
     }

     public MaximizeTest(String title)
     {
         super(title);
         setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

         //  Realize the window components
         pack();
     }
}

### Set a number of threads based on the number of CPUs

// Set the number of threads based on the number of CPUs with at least 2 threads
int nCPU = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
int nMaxThread = Math.min(ThreadPool.MAX_THREADS, nCPU + 1);
aThreadPool = StartThreadPool(nMaxThread, nMaxThread);

### Full rendering quality

   private void SetRenderingOptions(Graphics2D g2)
   {
      g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
      g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_TEXT_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_ON);
      g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_RENDERING, RenderingHints.VALUE_RENDER_QUALITY);

      g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_FRACTIONALMETRICS, RenderingHints.VALUE_FRACTIONALMETRICS_ON);
      g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_DITHERING, RenderingHints.VALUE_DITHER_ENABLE);
   }

### Accessing Web site from a computer behind a proxy

Properties systemSettings = System.getProperties();
systemSettings.put("http.proxyHost", "myProxyServer.com");
systemSettings.put("http.proxyPort", "80");
System.setProperties(systemSettings);

### Required Permissions for the Java 2 Platform

To run an application on a Java 2 Platform with the standard Security Manager, use the -Djava.security.manager option to the java command.
Web browser applets running in the Java 2 plug-in are always running in a JVM with the standard Java Security Manager enabled.
See jre/lib/security/java.policy
A specific security policy file can be specified with -Djava.security.policy=policyfile option (augment default policies) or -Djava.security.policy==policyfile option (double =) to replace them.

### Printing

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/2d/printing/index.html

http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/reference/faqs/index.html#Printing_questions

Q:What are the differences between the various printing APIs I see in the JDK?
A. These are the printing APIs in the JDK:

1.1 (aka AWT) printing - java.awt.PrintJob
    * A UI component-oriented printing API
    * Can print only the 1.1 "Graphics" API, not "Graphics2D" extensions

2D printing - java.awt.print.PrinterJob
    * A more flexible API for printing documents
    * Can print all of Java 2D.
    * Callback printing model
    * Integrates with javax.print

Java Printing Service - javax.print packages
    * Adds discovery of printers and capabilities
    * Adds ability to specify job behaviour through attributes
    * Adds ability to install custom print services

In summary 1.1/AWT printing can be used for many basic cases but has largely been superseded by 2D printing (as of J2SE 1.2), and when the javax.print package was added in J2SE 1.4 it was made largely complementary to 2D printing and integrated with it for ease of us. So most applications which are focused on rendering to a printer will find it more natural to centre around PrinterJob.

So the presently recommended way to print for most applications is to use java.awt.print.PrinterJob which has methods which leverage javax.print to enumerate printers, and can accept printing attributes from javax.print which define job printing behaviour such as duplex printing.

Q: When printing using java.awt.PrinterJob, why does it print each page at least twice (and sometimes much more than that)?
A: The root of this is that Java 2D printing needs to be able to print everything that Java 2D can render to the screen, and that includes translucent colours, images etc which cannot always be printed directly in Postscript or GDI except when printing everything as one big image, so the implementation tries to avoid this by calling first to discover the rendering that needs to be done for the page. If its simple opaque rendering then only one more call is needed to render the page. If there are translucent colours then multiple calls are done for "bands" down the page to limit the size of the image being generated and hence constrain peak memory usage.

Q How do I keep the information from getting cut off from the top and left sides of the page when I print using the Java 2D printing API?
A: Because many printers cannot print on the entire paper surface, the PageFormat specifies the imageable area of the page: this is the portion of the page in which it's safe to render. The specification of the imageable area does not alter the coordinate system; it is provided so that the contents of the page can be rendered so that they don't extend into the area where the printer can't print. If you find that information is clipped from your page, you might need to translate the information to the imageable area of the page, as shown in this sample:

    public int print(Graphics g, PageFormat pf, int pageIndex)
        throws PrinterException
    {
        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
        g2.translate(pf.getImageableX(),
        pf.getImageableY() + 72);
        ...
    }

Q: Why are my 1-pixel wide lines repositioned when I print them? How do I correct this?
A: For horizontal or vertical 1-pixel wide line fills, it is generally better to use fillRect rather than drawLine. The rounding of the drawLine method moves lines by half a device pixel, which make the lines appear more consistent whether or not antialiasing is applied. Therefore, if you have a 1-pixel wide line, the line is moved by half of its width. Because this adjustment occurs at the device-space level, your lines can move by half of a line width on printouts from high-resolution printers.

Q: How do I scale an image to fit a page?
A: Here is a sample code that uses the page's imageable width and height to scale an image.

public int print(Graphics graphics, PageFormat pageFormat, int
 pageIndex) throws PrinterException
 {
 if(pageIndex > 0)
    return Printable.NO_SUCH_PAGE;
 Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) graphics;

 //Set us to the upper left corner
 g2d.translate(pageFormat.getImageableX(), pageFormat.getImageableY());
 AffineTransform at = new AffineTransform();
 at.translate(0,0);

 //We need to scale the image properly so that it fits on one page.
 double xScale = pageFormat.getImageableWidth() / m_image.getWidth();
 double yScale = pageFormat.getImageableHeight() / m_image.getHeight();
 // Maintain the aspect ratio by taking the min of those 2 factors and
 using it to scale both dimensions.
 double aspectScale = Math.min(xScale, yScale);

 g2d.drawRenderedImage(m_image, at);
 return Printable.PAGE_EXISTS;
 }

Application is obtaining the HTML content from a URL. Data is ASCII-encoded
    DocFlavor htmlFlavor = DocFlavor.URL.TEXT_HTML_US_ASCII;
Or alternatively:
    DocFlavor htmlFlavor = new DocFlavor("text/plain;charset=ascii", "java.net.URL");

# Specify How to Print the Data: Printer Attributes
Printers have capabilities such as:
          o Paper sizes supported
          o Multiple media trays
          o Duplex (2-sided) printing
                + These are request attributes in the JPS API
                + They may be used in a print request to specify how the job is to be printed
Printer attributes such as name, location are service attributes
Attribute interface
          o Combines role of printer attribute category and attribute value
          o IPP attribute categories
          o First implementing class defines IPP category
                + All subclasses are the same category
          o Instances define particular values
Different attribute roles (service, request, job, etc).
JPS API represents these using subclasses of the Attribute interface, e.g., PrintRequestAttribute, PrintServiceAttribute
Applications may use both these attribute types (request and service) to select a suitable printer for a jobn, e.g., find a colour printer on the 3rd floor that can do large format duplex printing.
 PrintRequestAttribute examples
    * MediaSizeName class
          o Named paper sizes, e.g., ISO_A4, NA_LETTER, JIS_B5
    * Copies class
          o Number of document copies to print.
          o Client creates instance to hold integer
          o new Copies(99)
    * Sides class
          o Single or two sided printing.
          o Closed enumeration
          o ONE_SIDED
          o TWO_SIDED_LONG_EDGE
                + Same as DUPLEX
          o TWO_SIDED_SHORT_EDGE
                + Same as TUMBLE

### How To Generate JAD from JAR file
http://www.bitsforfree.eu/tips_and_tricks_jad.html

Some phones won't be able to download jar files above some size from the internet unless a JAD file is used to get information about the jar file first.

To create a jad file from jar file:

   1. Extract the jar file.
      If you don't know about a program to extract it, you can always rename it to zip and then extract it.
   2. Locate the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file and copy it to where the jar file is located.
   3. Rename the copied MANIFEST.MF to the same name as the jar file but with .jad extension.
   4. Open the copied file in text editor and edit the file as follows:
         1. Delete the lines, if they exist, that begin with:
               1. MIDlet-Jar-URL:
               2. MIDlet-Jar-Size:
         2. Add the following lines:
               1. MIDlet-Jar-URL: followed by a space character and the full jar filename.
               2. MIDlet-Jar-Size: followed by a space character and size (in bytes) of the jar file.
         3. Make sure the following lines exist, if they're not add each of them followed by space and its corresponding value:
               1. MIDlet-Name:
               2. MIDlet-Version:
               3. MIDlet-Vendor:
         4. Fix the following lines:
               1. It can cause problems if you have a non numeric text in the MIDlet-Version: line (. (dot) is permitted), if it's so you can just remove the non-numeric characters from the version value.
               2. Sometimes line's value will wrap to the next line. You should fix this, so that the whole value of that line will be on the same line. Happens a lot on MIDlet-1: (or 2,3.. instead of 1) lines.
               3. To place the Java application into the Games folder by default you can add or edit if it exists the following line:
                  Nokia-MIDlet-Category: Game
         5. It is safe to delete all lines that DO NOT begin with the following:
               1. MIDlet-
               2. MicroEdition-
               3. Nokia-MIDlet-Category
         6. If the application's certificate is causing problems on installation, the lines that begin with the following can be removed:
               1. MIDlet-Certificate-
               2. MIDlet-Jar-RSA-

java.net: J2ME Tutorial, Part 1: Creating MIDlets <http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/09/j2me1.html?page=2>

Packaging your MIDlet so that it ready for testing and deployment is a fairly involved process, with several steps. Although each step is straightforward, they must be followed in proper sequence.

The first step is to create a Manifest file. This Manifest file describes the contents of the Java Archive (JAR) file that we will be creating in the next step. There are several attributes that can go in this file, but for your Date-Time MIDlet, stick to only the ones that are required. This file's contents are shown here:

MIDlet-Name: DateTimeApp
MIDlet-Version: 1.0.0
MIDlet-Vendor: Vikram Goyal

Save this file as Manifest.mf in the C:\WTK22\article\output folder. (Note the newline after the last attribute, MIDlet-Vendor. It must be present, otherwise this attribute will not be recognized.)

Next, create the JAR file that packages up the preverified DateTimeApp.class file and the Manifest file. To create this JAR file, navigate to the C:\WTK22\article\output directory and issue the following command:

C:\WTK22\article\output>jar cvfm DateTimeApp.jar Manifest.mf .\com

This will create the DateTimeApp.jar file in the current (C:\WTK22\article\output) folder.

The second-to-last step is to create a file that has an extension of .jad. A Java Application Descriptor (JAD) file points to the location of the MIDlet it describes so that a J2ME device can install it. Again, this file can contain several attributes for a single MIDlet (or for several MIDlets), but for your Date-Time MIDlet, you will stick with the ones that are required.

MIDlet-1: DateTimeApp, , com.j2me.part1.DateTimeApp
MIDlet-Name: DateTimeApp
MIDlet-Version: 1.0.0
MIDlet-Vendor: Vikram Goyal
MIDlet-Jar-URL: DateTimeApp.jar
MIDlet-Jar-Size:
MicroEdition-Profile: MIDP-2.0
MicroEdition-Configuration: CLDC-1.1

Save this file as DateTimeApp.jad in the same folder as the JAR file (C:\WTK22\article\output). I will explain the attributes in this file later, but for now, note that the value of the MIDlet-Jar-Size attribute is missing. This missing value brings you to the last step of the packaging step, where you determine the size of the DateTimeApp.jar file, and put that value in this JAD file, in actual bytes. It is very important to get this exactly right, as the installation of this MIDlet will fail if this value is different from the actual size. On my machine, this value is 1469 bytes, and therefore, this is what this attribute looks like on my machine:

MIDlet-Jar-Size: 1469

This completes the packaging part.
